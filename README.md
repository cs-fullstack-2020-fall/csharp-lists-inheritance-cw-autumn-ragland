## Start by creating a new class called `ListClasswork`. Add a separate method for each exercise below as well as any additional methods requested. Access elements by index value (since we haven't done loops yet)

#### Exercise 1:
Ask the user to enter four names and add them to a List. Print each element from the List

#### Exercise 2:
Create a List containing [5,3,7,4]. Pass the List to a new method to do the following:
1) Print the List.
1) Print the 3rd element of the numberList.
2) Delete the second element.
3) Print the 3rd index element.

#### Exercise 3:
Create the List `["Bob", "John", "Autumn", "Kevin"]`.
1) Remove `Bob` from the List.
2) Print the List.
3) Print the size of the List.
4) Check to see if the List contains “Kevin”. If so, get the index of “Kevin” and print the value out.

#### Exercise 4:
Ask the user to enter 5 numbers. Put them in an List and print the sum.

#### Exercise 5:
Create an List in the exercise 5 method. Create two additional methods called `min` and `max`, to find the minimum and maximum values from the list passed in.

## Class Inheritance

#### Exercise 6:
- Create a base class called `Animal`with a method called `animalSound()` that prints `The animal made a sound` when called
- Create an instance of the `Animal` class
- Call the method `animalSound` of the base class

#### Exercise 7:
- Create a `Dog` class that inherits from the `Animal` class
  - Create a method that override the base `AnimalSound` method and prints `BARK!!!`
- Create a `Cat` class that inherits from the `Animal` class
  - Create a method that override the base `AnimalSound` method and prints `MEOW!!!`
- Create an instance of the `Animal` class and call `animalSound()`
- Create an instance of the `Dog` class and call `animalSound()`
- Create an instance of the `Cat` class and call `animalSound()`
